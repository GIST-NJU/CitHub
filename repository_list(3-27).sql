Our approach starts from a finite state model and applies model-based testing to generate test paths that represent sequences of events to be executed against the system under test. Such paths are transformed to classification trees, enriched with domain input specifications such as data types and partitions. Finally, executable test cases are generated from those trees using t-way combinatorial criteria.\r\n\r\nWhile test cases that satisfy a combinatorial criterion can be generated for each individual test path obtained from the model, we introduce a post-optimization algorithm that can guarantee the combinatorial criterion of choice on the whole set of test paths extracted from the model. The resulting test suite is smaller, but it still satisfies the same adequacy criterion. We developed a tool and used it to evaluate our approach on 6 subject systems of various types and sizes, to study the effectiveness of the generated test suites, the reduction achieved by the post-optimization algorithm, as well as the effort required to produce them.');

We show that the problem of generating a minimum test set for pairwise testing is NP-complete. We propose a test generation strategy, called in-parameter-order (or IPO), for pairwise testing. For a system with two or more input parameters, the IPO strategy generates a pairwise test set for the first two parameters, extends the test set to generate a pairwise test set for the first three parameters, and continues to do so for each additional parameter. The IPO strategy allows the use of local optimization techniques for test generation and the reuse of existing tests when a system is extended with new parameters or new values of existing parameters.

It often\r\nconsumes up to half of the overall software development cost. Even for simple software,\r\nexhaustive testing is infeasible because the number of possible test cases is typically prohibitively large. Therefore, much research has been aimed at simultaneously achieving\r\nhigh efficacy and reducing the cost of testing by selecting test cases appropriately.\r\nIn this dissertation, we discuss three issues on test case generation. First, we discuss\r\nspecification-based testing of an implementation that is intended to satisfy a given specification that is a Boolean formula. Since many portions of the behavior of software systems\r\ncan be represented as a Boolean formula, this type of testing is considered fundamental\r\nand should be developed so as to achieve more effectiveness.\r\nWe propose a new specification-based test case generation strategy, which we refer to\r\nas EMIS (Extended Meaningful Impact Strategy), that guarantees the detection of faults\r\nin most of the classes previously proposed. We examine the costs and effectiveness of\r\nEMIS and the previous ones. Experimental results show that EMIS can achieve a high\r\nerror detection rate with relatively low cost.\r\nSecond, we examine the applicability of non-specification-based test case generation\r\nstrategies for testing software that can be modeled as Boolean formulas. In this dissertation, we use the term non-specification-based approaches to refer to test case generation\r\nstrategies that only use information available in black-box environment other than specifications.\r\nA problem with specification-based testing is that specifications used for automatic\r\ntest case generation are not always available to testers in practice. However, little researchhas been done on the applicability of non-specification-based testing for software modeled\r\nas Boolean formulas.\r\nIn this issue, we examine three non-specification-based testing techniques: combinatorial testing, random testing, and antirandom testing. We compare these three testing\r\ntechniques with EMIS. The result of the comparison analysis shows that combinatorial\r\ntesting is often comparable to EMIS and is always much superior to both random testing\r\nand antirandom testing.\r\nLastly, as the third issue, we discuss constructing 2-factor covering designs, which are\r\nused as test sets in combinatorial testing. In the literature, it has been reported that testing\r\nbased on 2-factor covering designs is effective in various industrial applications including\r\nsoftware testing. For these applications, even a small reduction in the size of a design is\r\nsignificant, because it directly reduces testing costs. Therefore, much research has been\r\naimed at reducing the size of test sets.\r\nIn this dissertation, we propose new constructions and apply them to two cases that\r\noccurred in actual testing of an ATM network monitoring system. The results show that\r\nthe proposed construction can generate very small 2-factor covering designs, compared\r\nto the previously proposed algorithms.\r\nIn addition, we address the problem of constructing small 2-factor covering designs\r\nfor the case where all parameters have three values. This problem is called the ternary\r\nSpernery problem. We have obtained 10 new 2-factor covering designs, which improve\r\non previously known results, by making use of the proposed constructions.\r\nThis dissertation is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, we briefly summarize related\r\nprogress and topics in software testing, present main results we obtained and describe the\r\noutline of the dissertation. In Chapter 2, we describe some basic concepts of software\r\ntesting techniques. In this chapter, we first briefly explain code-based testing with an\r\nexample and then describe specification-based testing in detail.\r\nIn Chapter 3, we explain the proposed specification-based test generation strategy\r\nfor testing Boolean specifications. We first present a brief explanation of the work by\r\nWeyuker et al. Then we propose a new specification-based test generation strategy that\r\nii\r\nachieves the same effectiveness with relatively low cost.\r\nIn Chapter 4, we investigate the applicability of three non-specification-based strategies: random testing, antirandom testing, and combinatorial testing, for testing software\r\nthat can be modeled as Boolean formulas.\r\nIn Chapter 5, we present new constructions of 2-factor covering designs and the results\r\nof applying them to the ATM monitoring test example and the ternary Spernery problem.\r\nFinally, in Chapter 6, we conclude this dissertation with a summary and directions for\r\nfuture work.');

What is the appropriate value of n for particular classes of software? Does this value differ for different types of software, and by how much?

When a system is integrated, there may be undesired interactions among those components that cause system failures. There are two complementary problems in testing a software system. The first problem is to create a test suite, given a description of the expected behaviour of a system configuration. The second problem is to deal with a large number of distinct test configurations. We investigate the second problem in this thesis: the situation when there are various system parameters, each of which can take on a value from a discrete set. The trade-off that the system tester faces is the thoroughness of test configuration coverage, versus availability of limited resources. We introduce a coverage measure that can provide a basis for determining a set of configurations with \"sufficient\" coverage, or for evaluation of a set of test configurations that already exists. This thesis addresses the problem of testing interactions among components of a software system: the \"interaction test coverage\" problem. We formally define this problem, and give it a set-theoretic framework. This is done through the introduction of an \"interaction element,\" which becomes the unit of test coverage. The problem is compared to, and distinguished from, the minimum set cover problem and the {0,1} integer programming problem. As a result, the status of the NP-completeness of this problem remains open. Methods from statistical experimental design are introduced, and applied to the problem of generating a set of configurations that achieve coverage of all pair-wise combinations of parameter values. We present a fast, deterministic algorithm to generate such a set of test configurations. The method is compared with other methods, and shown to produce fewer configurations in most situations. The number of configurations generated is logarithmic in the number of parameters, and polynomial in the number of values per parameter. As a result, the number of configurations is usually feasible in practice, and is a significant reduction from the number of possible configurations.');

This paper introduces a systematic approach to the prototyping and the validation of a system\'s performance, by treating the prototyping or validation as an experiment, in which the fractional factorial design methodology is commonly used. To show that this is possible, a case study evaluating the influencing factors of the false and real target rate of a radar system is described. Our findings show that prototyping and validation of system performance become structured and effective when using the fractional factorial design. The methodology enables planning, performance, structured analysis, and gives guidance for appropriate test cases. The methodology yields not only main factors, but also interacting factors. The effort is minimized for finding the results, due to the methodology. The case study shows that after 112 test Cases, of 1,024 possible, the knowledge gained was enough to draw conclusions on the effects and interactions of 10 factors.

AC satisfies n-wise coverage, EC and BC satisfy 1-wise coverage, and OA and AETG satisfy pair-wise coverage. The All Combinations strategy was used as a “gold standard” strategy; it subsumes the others but is usually too expensive for practical use. The others were used in an experiment that used five programs seeded with 128 faults. The combination strategies were evaluated with respect to the number of test cases, the number of faults found, failure size, and number of decisions covered. The strategy that requires the least number of tests, Each Choice, found the smallest number of faults. Although the Base Choice strategy requires fewer test cases than Orthogonal Arrays and AETG, it found as many faults. Analysis also shows some properties of the combination strategies that appear significant.

A controlled study is designed and executed to compare the fault detection effectiveness of n-way and random test suites. Combinatorial testing is conducted on target systems that have been injected with software faults. The results are that there is no significant difference in the fault detection effectiveness of n-way and random test suites for the applications studied. Analysis of the random test suite finds that they are very similar to n-way test suites from the perspective of the number of test data combinations covered. This result concurs with other hypothetical results that indicate little difference between n-way and random test suites. While we do not expect this result to apply in all combinatorial testing situations, we believe the result will lead to the design of better combinatorial test suites.');

We conjecture that N-wise enhanced pairwise testing can be used as a black-boxed testing method to increase effectiveness of random testing in exposing unusual or unexpected behaviors, such as security failures in network-centric software. This testing can also be quite cost-efficient since small N test suites grow linearly with the number of parameters. This paper explains the results of random testing of a simulation in which about 20% of the defects with probabilities of occurrence less than 50% are never exposed. This supports the premise that if the unusual or unexpected behaviors are based on defects which are less likely to occur, then random testing needs to be enhanced, especially if those unexposed defects could cause erratic or even critical behaviors to the system. Higher system complexities may indicate higher numbers of unusual or unexpected behaviors. It may be difficult to use the traditional operational profile information to determine the amount of testing for unusual behaviors since the operational usage may be 0 or close to it. Another interesting problem is that some testers lack the experience necessary to effectively analyze the results of a test run. It is important to compensate for the lack of experience so that novice testers are able to test comparatively as effectively as more experienced testers. It is believed that if the size of the test suite is relatively small, then it may be easier to pinpoint the source of a failure. The research presented in this paper is aimed at addressing some of these issues of random testing via enhanced pairwise testing and N-wise testing in general. It is possible that more complex systems, such as those that rely a great deal on a network, would require higher numbers of interactions to combat unexpected combinations for use in some testing instances such as security testing or high assurance testing.

AC satisfies n-wise coverage, EC and BC satisfy 1-wise coverage, and OA and AETG satisfy pair-wise coverage.

The combination strategies were evaluated with respect to the number of test cases, the number of faults found, failure size, and number of decisions covered. The strategy that requires the least number of tests, Each Choice, found the smallest number of faults. Although the Base Choice strategy requires fewer test cases than Orthogonal Arrays and AETG, it found as many faults. Analysis also shows some properties of the combination strategies that appear significant.

In recent work, automated constraint solving methods have been combined with search-based CIT construction methods to address the constraint problem with promising results.

As a user request typically consists of multiple parameter values, the request generation problem can be further divided into two problems: (1) How to select appropriate values for individual parameters? (2) How to effectively combine individual parameter values to generate requests? This paper presents a combinatorial approach to building a navigation graph. The novelty of our approach is two-fold. First, we use an abstraction scheme to control the page explosion problem. In this scheme, pages that are likely to have the same navigation behavior are grouped together, and are represented as a single node in a navigation graph. Grouping pages reduces and bounds the size of a navigation graph for practical applications. Second, assuming that values of individual parameters are supplied by using other techniques or generated manually by the user, we combine parameter values in a way that achieves a well-defined combinatorial coverage called pairwise coverage. Using pairwise coverage can significantly reduce the number of requests that have to be submitted while still achieving effective coverage of the navigation structure. We report a prototype tool called Tansuo, and apply the tool to five open source Web applications. Our empirical results indicate that Tansuo can efficiently generate Web navigation graphs for these applications.');

The recent wide spreading usage of combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is dramatically improving the effectiveness of this activity. Although there exist analytical ways to derive minimal sized CIT test suites, they are not applicable to all task sizes. Therefore, researchers have explored many techniques based on greedy or heuristic algorithms that may lead to sub-optimal result in the size of the built test suite but that are applicable to problems of real size.

Applying this approach in practice, however, is tricky because testing time and resource availability are unpredictable, and because failure characteristics can change from release to release. With current approaches developers must set a key covering array parameter (its strength) based on estimated release times and failure characterizations. This will influence the outcome of their results.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose a new approach that incrementally builds covering array schedules. This approach begins at a low strength, and then iteratively increases strength as resources allow. At each stage previously tested configurations are reused, thus avoiding duplication of work. With the incremental approach developers need never commit to a specific covering array strength. Instead, by using progressively stronger covering array schedules, failures due to few configuration dependencies can be found and classified as soon and as cheaply as possibly. Additionally, it eliminates the risks of committing to overly strong test schedules.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate this new approach through a case study on three consecutive releases of MySQL, an open source database.

Thus we propose a HIPO algorithm based on IPO algorithm to solve those problems. The HIPO algorithm inherits the merits of high extension of IPO algorithm and introduces a new concept of contribution extent. It adopts the methods of preferential sequence as well as minimization algorithm to optimize the problems above. We develop the test case generation tool based on the HIPO algorithm by means of .Net technology. And we also prove its effectiveness in our experiment.');

But when testing a single system configuration is expensive, greedy techniques perform worse than meta-heuristic algorithms, because greedy algorithms generally need larger samples to exercise the same set of interactions. On the other hand, current meta-heuristic algorithms have long run times when feature constraints are present. Neither class of algorithm is suitable when both constraints and the cost of testing configurations are important factors. Therefore, we reformulate one meta-heuristic search algorithm for constructing CIT samples, simulated annealing, to more efficiently incorporate constraints. We identify a set of algorithmic changes and experiment with our modifications on 35 realistic constrained problems and on a set of unconstrained problems from the literature to isolate the factors that improve performance. Our evaluation determines that the optimizations reduce run time by a factor of 90 and accomplish the same coverage objectives with even fewer system configurations.

This type of testing combines existing fault-based testing techniques, such as fault injection, with combinatorial testing to attempt to find faults of varying strength within a web service. Combinatorial fault-based testing uses fault injection and helps reduce the problem with combinatorial explosion by focusing solely on fault-based combinations.

Generating pairwise test sets with a minimal size has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, and several deterministic generation algorithms have been published. This paper describes the results of an investigation of pairwise test set generation using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm approach produced pairwise test sets with comparable or smaller (better) size compared with published results for deterministic algorithms for 39 out of 40 benchmark problems. However, the genetic algorithm test set generation technique required significantly longer processing time in all cases. The results illustrate that generation of pairwise test sets using a genetic algorithm is possible, and suggest that the technique may be both practical and useful in certain software testing situations.');

Combinatorial testing of strength t (t ≥ 2) requires that each t-wise tuple of values of the different system input parameters is covered by at least one test case. Combinatorial test suite generation algorithms aim at producing a test suite covering all the required tuples in a small (possibly minimal) number of test cases, in order to reduce the cost of testing. The most used combinatorial technique is the pairwise testing (t = 2) which requires coverage of all pairs of input values. Constrained combinatorial testing takes also into account constraints over the system parameters, for instance forbidden tuples of inputs, modeling invalid or not realizable input values combinations. In this paper a new approach to combinatorial testing, tightly integrated with formal logic, is presented. In this approach, test predicates are used to formalize combinatorial testing as a logical problem, and an external formal logic tool is applied to solve it. Constraints over the input domain are expressed as logical predicates too, and effectively handled by the same tool. Moreover, inclusion or exclusion of select tuples is supported, allowing the user to customize the test suite layout.

It was reported in literature that pairwise combinatorial interaction testing had identified most of the software faults. Approach: In this study we proposed a new strategy for test suite generation, a tree generation strategy for pairwise combinatorial software testing, with parameters of equal values. The algorithm considered one parameter at a time systematically to generate the tree until all the parameters were considered. This strategy used a cost calculation technique iteratively for each of the leaf nodes to generate the test suite until all the combinations were covered. Results: The experimental data showed that we had achieved about 88% (or more in some cases) of reduction in the number of test cases needed for a complete pairwise combinatorial software interaction testing.

This paper proposes an enhanced pairwise search approach (PS2Way) of input values for optimum test data generation. This approach searches the most coverable pairs by pairing parameters and adopts one-test-at-a-time strategy to construct final test suites. PS2Way is effective in terms of number of generated test cases and execution time compared to other existing strategies.');

The bow tie testing pattern describes how the configurations which differ only in the implementation layer require one test suite. In addition, comparing the execution results of one product with another provides for a test oracle. The pattern reduces the effort of testing a highly configurable system without reducing the error detection capabilities provided by ordinary combinatorial interaction testing.

As a result, many helpful t-way sampling strategies have been developed and can be found in the literature.\r\n\r\nSeveral advances have been achieved in the last 15 years, which have, in particular, served to facilitate the test planning process by systematically minimizing the test size required (based on certain t-way parameter interactions). Despite this significant progress, the integration and automation of strategies (from planning process to execution) are still lacking. Additionally, strategizing to sample (and construct) a minimum test set from the exhaustive test space is an NP-complete problem; that is, it is often unlikely that an efficient strategy exists that could regularly generate an optimal test set. Motivated by these challenges, this paper discusses the design, implementation, and validation of an efficient strategy for t-way testing, the GTWay strategy. The main contribution of GTWay is the integration of t-way test data generation with automated (concurrent) execution as part of its tool implementation.

Therefore, launching a successful attack often amounts to a clever way of tweaking the values of external parameters. We simulate the process performed by the attacker, but in a more systematic manner. A novel aspect of our approach is that it adapts a general software testing technique called combinatorial testing to the domain of security testing. In particular, our approach exploits the fact that combinatorial testing often achieves a high level of code coverage. We have implemented our approach in a prototype tool called Tance.

Using such services in tandem to predictably orchestrate a complex task is one of the principal challenges of service-oriented computing. A composite service orchestration soliciting multiple atomic services is plagued by a number of sources of variation. For instance, availability of an atomic service and its response time are two important sources of variation. Moreover, the number of possible variations in a composite service increases exponentially with increase in the number of atomic services. Testing such a composite service presents a crucial challenge as its often very expensive to exhaustively examine the variation space. Can we effectively test the dynamic behavior of a composite service using only a subset of these variations? This is the question that intrigues us. In this paper, we first model composite service variability as a feature diagram (FD) that captures all valid configurations of its orchestration. Second, we apply pairwise testing to sample the set of all possible configurations to obtain a concise subset. Finally, we test the composite service for selected pairwise configurations for a variety of QoS metrics such as response time, data quality, and availability. Using two case studies, Car crash crisis management and eHealth management, we demonstrate that pairwise generation effectively samples the full range of QoS variations in a dynamic orchestration. The pairwise sampling technique eliminates over 99% redundancy in configurations, while still calling all atomic services at least once. We rigorously evaluate pairwise testing for the criteria such as: a) ability to sample the extreme QoS metrics of the service b) stable behavior of the extracted configurations c) compact set of configurations that can help evaluate QoS tradeoffs and d) comparison with random sampling.');

However, high levels of configurability entail new challenges. Some faults might be revealed only if a particular combination of features is selected in the delivered products. But testing all combinations is usually not feasible in practice, due to their extremely large numbers. Combinatorial testing is a technique to generate smaller test suites for which all combinations of t features are guaranteed to be tested. In this paper, we present several theorems describing the probability of random testing to detect interaction faults and compare the results to combinatorial testing when there are no constraints among the features that can be part of a product. For example, random testing becomes even more effective as the number of features increases and converges toward equal effectiveness with combinatorial testing. Given that combinatorial testing entails significant computational overhead in the presence of hundreds or thousands of features, the results suggest that there are realistic scenarios in which random testing may outperform combinatorial testing in large systems. Furthermore, in common situations where test budgets are constrained and unlike combinatorial testing, random testing can still provide minimum guarantees on the probability of fault detection at any interaction level. However, when constraints are present among features, then random testing can fare arbitrarily worse than combinatorial testing. As a result, in order to have a practical impact, future research should focus on better understanding the decision process to choose between random testing and combinatorial testing, and improve combinatorial testing in the presence of feature constraints.');

Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) approaches, such as covering arrays, systematically sample the configuration space and test only the selected configurations by using a battery of test cases. Traditional covering arrays, while taking system-wide interoption constraints into account, do not provide a systematic way of handling test case-specific interoption constraints. The basic justification for $(t)$-way covering arrays is that they can cost effectively exercise all system behaviors caused by the settings of $(t)$ or fewer options. In this paper, we hypothesize, however, that in the presence of test case-specific interoption constraints, many such behaviors may not be tested due to masking effects caused by the overlooked test case-specific constraints. For example, if a test case refuses to run in a configuration due to an unsatisfied test case-specific constraint, none of the valid option setting combinations appearing in the configuration will be tested by that test case. To account for test case-specific constraints, we introduce a new combinatorial object, called a test case-aware covering array. A $(t)$-way test case-aware covering array is not just a set of configurations, as is the case in traditional covering arrays, but a set of configurations, each of which is associated with a set of test cases such that all test case-specific constraints are satisfied and that, for each test case, each valid combination of option settings for every combination of $(t)$ options appears at least once in the set of configurations that the test case is associated with. We furthermore present three algorithms to compute test case-aware covering arrays. Two of the algorithms aim to minimize the number of configurations required (one is fast, but produces larger arrays, the other is slower, but produces smaller arrays), whereas the remaining algorithm aims to minimize the number of test runs required. The results of our empirical studies conducted on two widely used highly configurable software systems suggest that test case-specific constraints do exist in practice, that traditional covering arrays suffer from masking effects caused by ignorance of such constraints, and that test case-aware covering arrays are better than other approaches in handling test case-specific constraints, thus avoiding masking effects.');

By doing so, they assume that the testing cost of a configuration is the same for all configurations. In my thesis work, we however argue that, in practice, the actual testing cost may differ from one configuration to another and that accounting for these differences can improve the cost-effectiveness of covering arrays. To this end, we introduced a new novel combinatorial object, called a cost-aware covering array where a t-way cost-aware covering array is a t-way covering array that minimizes a given cost function. As part of progress, we developed an algorithm for a simple, yet important scenario, and the results of our empirical studies suggest that cost-aware covering arrays can greatly reduce the actual cost of testing compared to traditional covering arrays. We also defined a framework for defining the cost function but then we observed that manually creating these cost models is impractical. Hence our first future goal is to develop an approach for automatically discovering cost models for complex configuration spaces. Our second future goal is then to develop algorithms to generate cost-aware covering arrays for more general cost scenarios. Our focus is currently on meta-heuristic search algorithms such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to construct cost-aware covering arrays. Another goal is to expand the cost framework to be test-case aware where not every test case is valid for a configuration, hence the cost of running the test suite is actually different for each configuration.');

While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks,such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory,unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore,every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system\'s effective configuration space - the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal - could comprise only a tiny subset of the system\'s full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system\'s effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system\'s behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The key improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions - a construct that improves iTree\'s ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree\'s running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the ~ 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.');

Numerous case studies have appeared presenting practical applications of the combinatorial test suite design techniques, often comparing them with manually-created, random, or exhaustive suites. These comparisons are done either in terms of defects found or by applying some code coverage metric. Since many different and valid combinatorial test suites of strength t can be created for a given test domain, the question whether they all have the same coverage properties is a pertinent one. In this paper we explore the stability of size and coverage of combinatorial test suites. We find that in general coverage levels increase and coverage variability decreases with increasing order of combinations t; however we also find exceptions with implications for practitioners. In addition, we explore cases where coverage achieved by combinatorial test suites of order t applied to the same program is not different from test suites of order t-1.

The test space is manually modeled by a set of parameters, their respective values, and restrictions on the value combinations - referred to as a CTD model. Each possible combination of values in the cross product of the parameters, that is not excluded by restrictions, represents a valid test. A subset of the test space is then automatically constructed so that it covers all valid value combinations of every t parameters, where t is usually a user input. In many real-life testing problems, the relationships between the different test parameters are complex. Thus, precisely capturing them by restrictions in the CTD model might be a very challenging and time consuming task. Since the test space is of exponential size in the number of parameters, it is impossible to exhaustively review all potential tests. In this paper, we present technology that supports the modeling process by enabling repeated reviews of projections of the test space on a subset of the parameters, while indicating how the value combinations under review are affected by the restrictions. In addition, we generate explanations as to why the restrictions exclude specific value combinations of the subsets of parameters under review. These explanations can be used to identify modeling mistakes, as well as to increase the understanding of the test space. Furthermore, we identify specific excluded combinations that may require special attention, and list them for review together with their corresponding exclusion explanation. To enable the review of subsets of the exponential test space, indicate their status, and identify excluded combinations for review, we use a compact representation of the test space that is based on Binary Decision Diagrams.

Testing configurable software requires extra effort over testing traditional software because there is evidence that running the same test case under different configurations may detect different faults. Differentiating test cases and configurations as two independent factors for testing, we must consider not just which test case to utilize, but also which configurations to test. Ideally, an exhaustive testing approach would combine every test case with every possible configuration. But since the full configuration space of most software systems is huge, it is infeasible to test all possible configurations with all test cases. Instead, selection techniques are necessary to select configurations for testing a software system, and to select test cases for the different configurations under test.\r\n\r\nDespite successful selection techniques, sometimes it is still costly to run only selected configurations and test cases. In particular, the cost is magnified when new features and functionality are added as a system evolves, and the new version is regression tested. Regression testing is an important but expensive way to build confidence that software changes do not introduce new faults as the software evolves, and many efforts have been made to improve its performance given limited resources. Test case prioritization has been extensively researched to determine which test cases should be run first, but has rarely been considered for configurations. In this chapter we introduce issues relevant to testing configurable software systems, we then present techniques for both selection and prioritization of these systems.\r\n\r\n');

Weighting makes this strategy more effective by allowing the tester to have more control over the resulting test suite. However, there is not much research on weighting. To our knowledge, all existing weighting methods treat weights as a second class requirement and cannot generate a test suite that sufficiently respects the given weights. The proposed method aims to overcome the problem. By taking into consideration the parameter value distribution in the current test suite and the ideal one specified by the given weights, the method generates each test case so that the resulting test suite can reflect the weights as accurately as possible.

Time constraints often prevent them from finding an array of competitive size. We examine a different approach. Having used a simple computation or construction to find a covering array, we employ a post-optimization technique that repeatedly adjusts the array in an attempt to reduce its number of rows. At every stage the array retains full coverage. We demonstrate its value on a collection of previously best known arrays by eliminating, in some cases, 10% of their rows.

In this paper, we apply weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to minimize the test suite for testing a product, while preserving fault detection capability and testing coverage of the original test suite. The challenge behind is to define an appropriate fitness function, which is able to preserve the coverage of complex testing criteria (e.g., Combinatorial Interaction Testing criterion).

By assuming the number of faulty interactions is under control, the partial covering array, whose size grows logarithmically with the number of parameters, can serve as a test suite for locating faulty interactions in the nonadaptive faulty interaction locating process.

To improve testing cost-effectiveness, prioritization of combinatorial test cases is employed. The most popular approach is based on interaction coverage, which prioritizes combinatorial test cases by repeatedly choosing an unexecuted test case that covers the largest number of uncovered parameter value combinations of a given strength (level of interaction among parameters). However, this approach suffers from some drawbacks. Based on previous observations that the majority of faults in practical systems can usually be triggered with parameter interactions of small strengths, we propose a new strategy of prioritizing combinatorial test cases by incrementally adjusting the strength values.

Most approaches for SPL pairwise testing have focused on achieving full coverage of all pairwise feature combinations with the minimum number of products to test. Though useful in many contexts, this single-objective perspective does not reflect the prevailing scenario where software engineers do face trade-offs between the objectives of maximizing the coverage or minimizing the number of products to test.

We developed three seeding strategies — techniques that leverage problem domain knowledge — and measured their performance impact on a large and diverse corpus of case studies using two well-known multi-objective quality measures. Our study identifies the performance differences among the algorithms and corroborates that the more domain knowledge leveraged the better the search results.

To address this challenging problem, some researchers proposed a randomized post-optimization method to reduce the number of rows in a covering array that has been already constructed. It repeatedly adjusts the array without loss of coverage. However, it seems that this method is not efficient as desired. In order to improve its efficiency, we propose a refined algorithm to replace the randomized algorithm adopted in the method. This avoids the local optima problem that arises in randomized algorithm. Experimental results are presented to confirm the benefits of the refined algorithm. In the cases of CA(N, 6, k, 2) (38 ≤ k ≤ 50) generated by IPO, this refined algorithm not only reduces more number of rows than the randomized algorithm, but also produces covering arrays that are smaller than previously best known ones. Furthermore, we provide a reasonable estimator to predict the extent to which covering arrays can be improved by this refined algorithm.');

We also compare two different prioritization strategies by a series of experiments, and discuss the advantages of our prioritization strategy and the selection of prioritization techniques. The results show that prioritization by switching cost can improve testing efficiency and our prioritization strategy can produce a small test suite with a reasonably low switching cost.

We also use two criteria that consider the order in which events occur since different orderings of events may be valuable during testing. First, the consecutive sequence-based criterion counts all event sequences in different orders, but they must occur adjacent to each other. The sequence-based criterion counts pairs in all orders without the requirement that events must be adjacent. We evaluate the new criteria on three GUI applications. We use 2way inter-window coverage in our studies. All of the 2way combinatorial-based criteria are effective in reducing the test suites and maintaining close to 100% fault finding effectiveness.

In this paper, we explore the applicability of test case prioritization techniques to SPL testing.

Existing research unveils that adaptive random prioritization (ARP) of test cases is an alternative and promising candidate that may replace RP. However, previous ARP techniques may not be used to prioritize interaction test suites due to the lack of source-code-related information in interaction test suite, such as statement coverage, function coverage, or branch coverage.

This paper proposes (a) a search-based approach capable of generating product configurations for large SPLs, forming a scalable and flexible alternative to current techniques and (b) prioritization algorithms for any set of product configurations. Both these techniques employ a similarity heuristic. The ability of the proposed techniques is assessed in an empirical study through a comparison with state of the art tools. The comparison focuses on both the product configuration generation and the prioritization aspects. The results demonstrate that existing t-wise tools and prioritization techniques fail to handle large SPLs. On the contrary, the proposed techniques are both effective and scalable. Additionally, the experiments show that the similarity heuristic can be used as a viable alternative to t-wise.');

While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks,such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory,unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore,every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system\'s effective configuration space - the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal - could comprise only a tiny subset of the system\'s full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system\'s effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system\'s behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The key improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions - a construct that improves iTree\'s ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree\'s running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the ~ 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.');

Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) approaches, such as covering arrays, systematically sample the configuration space and test only the selected configurations. The basic justification for CIT approaches is that they can cost-effectively exercise all system behaviors caused by the settings of t or fewer options. We conjecture, however, that in practice some of these behaviors are not actually tested because of unanticipated masking effects - test case failures that perturb system execution so as to prevent some behaviors from being exercised. While prior research has identified this problem, most solutions require knowing the masking effects a priori. In practice this is impractical, if not impossible. In this work, we reduce the harmful consequences of masking effects. First we define a novel interaction testing criterion, which aims to ensure that each test case has a fair chance to test all valid t-way combinations of option settings. We then introduce a feedback driven adaptive combinatorial testing process (FDA-CIT) to materialize this criterion in practice. At each iteration of FDA-CIT, we detect potential masking effects, heuristically isolate their likely causes (i.e., fault characterization), and then generate new samples that allow previously masked combinations to be tested in configurations that avoid the likely failure causes. The iterations end when the new interaction testing criterion has been satisfied. This paper compares two different fault characterization approaches - an integral part of the proposed approach, and empirically assesses their effectiveness and efficiency in removing masking effects on two widely used open source software systems. It also compares FDA-CIT against error locating arrays, a state of the art approach for detecting and locating failures. Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing it with perfect test scenarios, in which all masking effects are known a priori. Our results suggest that masking effects do exist in practice, and that our approach provides a promising and efficient way to work around them, without requiring that masking effects be known a priori.');

It generally aims at generating an effective test suite (an interaction test suite) in order to identify faults that are caused by parameter interactions. Due to some constraints in practical applications (e.g. limited testing resources), for example in combinatorial interaction regression testing, prioritized interaction test suites (called interaction test sequences) are often employed. Consequently, many strategies have been proposed to guide the interaction test suite prioritization. It is, therefore, important to be able to evaluate the different interaction test sequences that have been created by different strategies. A well-known metric is the Average Percentage of Combinatorial Coverage (shortly APCCλ), which assesses the rate of interaction coverage of a strength λ (level of interaction among parameters) covered by a given interaction test sequence S. However, APCCλ has two drawbacks: firstly, it has two requirements (that all test cases in S be executed, and that all possible λ-wise parameter value combinations be covered by S ); and secondly, it can only use a single strength λ (rather than multiple strengths) to evaluate the interaction test sequence-which means that it is not a comprehensive evaluation. To overcome the first drawback, we propose an enhanced metric Normalized APCCλ (NAPCC) to replace the APCCλ. Additionally, to overcome the second drawback, we propose three new metrics: the Average Percentage of Strengths Satisfied (APSS); the Average Percentage of Weighted Multiple Interaction Coverage (APWMIC); and the Normalized APWMIC (NAPWMIC). These metrics comprehensively assess a given interaction test sequence by considering different interaction coverage at different strengths. Empirical studies show that the proposed metrics can be used to distinguish different interaction test sequences, and hence can be used to compare different test prioritization strategies.');

Going a step further, we apply mutation analysis on the CIT input model to select program test cases. Mutation operates by injecting defects to the program input model and measures the number of defects found by the selected test cases.

To redress this situation, this paper conducts a case study of applying pairwise testing to system data derived from real-valued variable inputs. In order to apply pairwise testing to this case study, this paper develops a test procedure and a novel partitioning method to test derived data as a naïve application of the conventional pairwise testing that would produce a huge number of test cases.

Interaction-based Test-Suite Minimization (ITSM) is a complementary approach to standard CTD, which reduces a given test suite without impacting its coverage of feature interactions. ITSM requires much less modeling effort, and does not require a definition of restrictions or generation of new test data. On the other hand, it does not improve the coverage obtained by the given test suite. In this work, we introduce Minimization Generation CTD (MG-CTD). MG-CTD is a combination of CTD with ITSM for addressing situations in which CTD is impractical, and ITSM is insufficient. In MG-CTD, one can define a subset of the parameters that can be freely assigned, as in CTD. The other parameter combinations must be selected from an existing set, as in ITSM. MG-CTD is suitable when for some parts of the test space it is easy to specify restrictions and generate new test data, while for others it is not. MG-CTD can be viewed as an enhancement of ITSM, and always achieves better interaction coverage than ITSM. We discuss the trade-offs between CTD, ITSM and MG-CTD, and present an efficient implementation which is based on binary decision diagrams. We then present some of the measures that one should take when implementing such an approach, in order to achieve the best possible coverage in the final result.

Furthermore, we propose an on-demand strategy that only generates minimum forbidden tuples for validity checks as they are encountered, instead of generating all of them up front. We implemented our generalized approach with and without the on-demand strategy in our combinatorial testing tool called ACTS. We performed experiments on 35 systems using ACTS and PICT.

In this work we examine how two of the most popular algorithms for combinatorial test case generation, namely the IPOG and IPOG-F algorithms, perform in web security testing. For generating comprehensive and sophisticated testing inputs we have used input parameter modelling which includes also constraints between the different parameter values. To handle the test execution, we make use of a recently introduced methodology which is based on model-based testing. Our evaluation indicates that both algorithms generate test inputs that succeed in revealing security leaks in web applications with IPOG-F giving overall slightly better results w.r.t. the test quality of the generated inputs. In addition, using constraints during the modelling of the attack grammars results in an increase on the number of test inputs that cause security breaches. Last but not least, a detailed analysis of our evaluation results confirms that combinatorial testing is an efficient test case generation method for web security testing as the security leaks are mainly due to the interaction of a few parameters. This statement is further supported by some combinatorial coverage measurement experiments on the successful test inputs.');

An alternative practice is to flatten the CIT model into a Boolean model and use Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. However, the flattening process artificially increases the size of the employed models, raising the question of whether it is profitable or not in the CIT context. This paper investigates this question and demonstrates that flattened models, despite being much larger, are processed faster with SAT solvers than the smaller original ones with SMT solvers.

From a practical point of view, combining pair-wise and MC/DC testing would integrate the benefits of both approaches; however, this would require solving many research problems. As an initial step in this direction, our paper evaluates the level of MC/DC coverage for pair-wise test cases in different situations and compares this level to MC/DC coverage for random test cases. To confirm this, we conducted experimental testing of logical expressions of different sizes, complexities, and numbers of input variables. Our experimental results show that the pair-wise test cases had a higher level of MC/DC coverage compared to the random test cases, achieving more than 70% MC/DC coverage.

As predictors, we decide to use decision trees because they have been one of the most widely used decision support tool for many years. Their attraction lies in the simplicity of the resulting model, where a decision tree (at least one that is not too large) is quite easy to view, understand, and, importantly, explain even if it may not always deliver the best performances.

To address this problem we propose a locating array (LA) as a screening design. Locating arrays exhibit logarithmic growth in the number of factors because their focus is on identification rather than on measurement. This makes practical the consideration of an order of magnitude more factors in experimentation than traditional screening designs. We present preliminary results applying an LA for screening the response of TCP throughput in a simulation model of a mobile wireless network. The full-factorial design for this system is infeasible (over 1043 design points!) yet an LA has only 421 design points.

For given values of k and t, the direct method uses an explicit formula in terms of both k and t to provide a covering array CA(N;t,k,2) expressed as the juxtaposition of a set of binomial coefficients; this covering array will be of the minimum size that can be obtained by any juxtaposition of binomial coefficients. In order to derive the formula, a Branch & Bound (B&B) algorithm was first developed; the B&B algorithm provided solutions for small values of k and t that allowed the identification of the general pattern of the solutions. Like others previously reported methods, our direct method finds optimal covering arrays for k=t+1\r\n and k=t+2\r\n; however, the major achievement is that nine upper bounds were significantly improved by our direct method, plus the fact that the method is able to set an infinite number of new upper bounds for t≥7\r\n given that little work has been done to compute binary covering arrays for general values of k and t.');

However, current PSO methods for covering array generation simply round the particle\'s position to an integer to handle the discrete search space. Moreover, no guidelines are available to effectively set PSOs parameters for this problem. In this paper, we extend the set-based PSO, an existing discrete PSO (DPSO) method, to covering array generation. Two auxiliary strategies (particle reinitialization and additional evaluation of gbest) are proposed to improve performance, and thus a novel DPSO for covering array generation is developed. Guidelines for parameter settings both for conventional PSO (CPSO) and for DPSO are developed systematically here. Discrete extensions of four existing PSO variants are developed, in order to further investigate the effectiveness of DPSO for covering array generation. Experiments show that CPSO can produce better results using the guidelines for parameter settings, and that DPSO can generate smaller covering arrays than CPSO and other existing evolutionary algorithms.

Combinatorial interaction testing approaches, such as covering arrays, systematically sample the configuration space and test only the selected configurations. Traditional t-way covering arrays aim to cover all t-way combinations of option settings in a minimum number of configurations. By doing so, they assume that the testing cost of a configuration is the same for all configurations. In my thesis work, we however argue that, in practice, the actual testing cost may differ from one configuration to another and that accounting for these differences can improve the cost-effectiveness of covering arrays. To this end, we introduced a new novel combinatorial object, called a cost-aware covering array where a t-way cost-aware covering array is a t-way covering array that minimizes a given cost function. As part of progress, we developed an algorithm for a simple, yet important scenario, and the results of our empirical studies suggest that cost-aware covering arrays can greatly reduce the actual cost of testing compared to traditional covering arrays. We also defined a framework for defining the cost function but then we observed that manually creating these cost models is impractical. Hence our first future goal is to develop an approach for automatically discovering cost models for complex configuration spaces. Our second future goal is then to develop algorithms to generate cost-aware covering arrays for more general cost scenarios. Our focus is currently on meta-heuristic search algorithms such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to construct cost-aware covering arrays. Another goal is to expand the cost framework to be test-case aware where not every test case is valid for a configuration, hence the cost of running the test suite is actually different for each configuration.');

The basic IPO strategies of horizontal and vertical growth address test suite size, but not the early detection of faults. In this paper, the growth strategies in IPO are modified to attempt to evenly distribute the values of each parameter across the tests.

A drawback of these approaches, however, is that, when selecting each test case, they only consider a fixed strength, not multiple strengths. To overcome this, we propose a new “aggregate-strength prioritization”, to combine interaction coverage at different strengths.

Software Product Line (SPL) development is a recent paradigm, where a family of software systems is constructed by means of the reuse of a set of common functionalities and some variable functionalities. An essential artefact of a SPL is the feature model, which shows the features offered by the product line, jointly with the relationships (includes and excludes) among them. Pairwise testing could be used to obtain the product sampling to test in a SPL, using features as pairwise parameters. In this context, the constraint handling becomes essential. As a difference with respect to other tools, CTWeb does not require SAT solvers.\r\n\r\nThis paper describes the PROW algorithm, also analysing its complexity and efficiency.

These specifications express the app’s behavior (i.e., control flow between the various app screens) as well as the GUI elements and their dependencies. The dependencies among the GUI elements comprising the app are used to reduce the number of combinations with the help of a solver. Our experiments have corroborated TrimDroid’s ability to achieve a comparable coverage as that possible under exhaustive GUI testing using significantly fewer test cases.');

The former is important to improve software quality and the latter to reduce the time of analysis. In a nutshell, we found that sampling algorithms with larger sample sets are able to detect higher numbers of faults, but simple algorithms with small sample sets, such as most-enabled-disabled, are the most efficient in most contexts. Furthermore, we observed that the limiting assumptions made in previous work influence the number of detected faults, the size of sample sets, and the ranking of algorithms.

We further reduce the amount of time spent in SAT solving by essentially ignoring constraints while constructing each test case, but then “amending” it to obtain a test case that satisfies the constraints, again using unsatisfiable cores. Finally, to complement a disturbance due to ignoring constraints, we implement an efficient approximative SAT checking function in the SAT solver Lingeling.

In this paper, we apply a combinatorial test data generation approach to two real-world ETL applications at Medidata. In our approach, we first create Input Domain Models (IDMs) automatically by analyzing the original data source and incorporating constraints manually derived from requirements. Next, the IDMs are used to create test data sets that achieve t-way coverage, which has shown to be very effective in detecting software faults. The generated test data sets also satisfy all the constraints identified in the first step. To avoid creating IDMs from scratch when there is a change to the original data source or constraints, our approach extends the original IDMs with additional information. The new IDMs, which we refer to as Adaptive IDMs (AIDMs), are updated by comparing the changes against the additional information, and are then used to generate new test data sets. We implement our approach in a tool, called comBinatorial big daTa Test dAta Generator (BIT-TAG). Our experience shows that combinatorial testing can be effectively applied to big data applications.

An intuitive ITSP strategy that has been widely used in practice is fixed-strength interaction coverage based prioritization (FICBP). FICBP makes use of a property of the ITS: interaction coverage at a fixed prioritization strength. However, a challenge facing FICBP is that, when the ITS is large, the prioritization cost can be very high. In this paper, we propose a new FICBP method that, by repeatedly using base choice coverage (i.e., one-wise coverage) during the prioritization process, improves testing efficiency while maintaining testing effectiveness. The empirical studies show that our method has fault detection capability comparable to current FICBP methods, but obtains more stable results in many cases. Additionally, our method requires considerably less prioritization time than other FICBP methods at different prioritization strengths.');

Display Omitted ContextTest suite prioritization is a problem of deciding the order of executing test cases to reach the desirable outcome. Many cost-cognisant prioritization approaches decide the order based on the cost of test execution; but few based on the cost of switching test cases. The latter known as switching cost is the effort of re-configuring the environment for running subsequent test cases. Our previous studies show that switching cost can affect the efficiency of testing. ObjectiveIn this paper, we aim to identify the optimal testing order that can detect interaction triggered faults earlier in the presence switching cost. MethodWe presented a distance based metric to measure the switching cost between test cases. As reducing the switching cost can make the whole test suite run faster and thus achieve full combination coverage earlier, single-objective algorithms were used to minimize the total switching cost. Besides, when determining the next test case to run, there is a trade-off between high combination coverage and low switching cost. Hence, hybrid and multi-objective algorithms were used to achieve a better balance. In order to evaluate different algorithms, we conducted a series of experiments covering 400 different testing scenarios. We also conducted an empirical study with six real world applications. ResultsThe heuristic solver for the travelling salesman problem is the best algorithm to minimize the switching cost. It can detect faults earlier than the order with high rate of combination coverage. But in order to further reduce the effort to detect the first fault, the hybrid and multi-objective algorithms are the best methods. ConclusionPrioritization based on switching cost can speed up the fault detection to some extent, but prioritization based on both combination coverage and testing cost can deliver the optimal testing order.');

Combinatorial interaction testing approaches, such as covering arrays, systematically sample the configuration space and test only the selected configurations. In an attempt to reduce the cost of testing, standard t-way covering arrays aim to cover all t-way combinations of option settings in a minimum number of configurations. By doing so, they simply assume that every configuration costs the same. When the cost varies from one configuration to another, however, minimizing the number of configurations is not necessarily the same as minimizing the cost. To overcome this issue, we have recently introduced cost-aware covering arrays. In a nutshell, a t-way cost-aware covering array is a standard t-way covering array that “minimizes” a given cost function modeling the actual cost of testing. In this work we develop a simulated annealing-based approach to compute cost-aware covering arrays, which takes as input a configuration space model enhanced with a cost function and computes a cost-aware covering array by using two alternating neighboring state generation strategies together with a fitness function expressed as a weighted sum of two objectives: covering all required t-way option setting combinations and minimizing the cost function. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first approach that computes cost-aware covering arrays for general, non-additive linear cost functions with multiplicative interaction effects. We evaluate the approach both by conducting controlled experiments, in which we systematically vary the input models to study the sensitivity of the approach to various factors and by conducting experiments using real cost functions for real software systems. We also compare cost-aware covering arrays to standard covering arrays constructed by well-known algorithms and study how fast the construction costs are compensated by the cost reductions provided. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed approach is more effective and efficient than the existing approaches.');

Perhaps surprisingly, we found little difference between black-box and white-box performance (at most 4% fault detection rate difference). We also found the overlap between black- and white-box faults to be high: the first 10% of the prioritized test suites already agree on at least 60% of the faults found.

Armed with this criterion, we perform an exploratory study on hundreds of faults from the field in two open source systems. We find that only three of the 28 which appear to be interaction faults are in fact due to features\' interactions. We investigate the remaining 25 and find that, although they could have been detected without interaction testing, varying the system configuration amplifies the fault-finding power of a test suite, making these faults easier to expose.

Strength t (or t-way) CDC requires each t-tuple of decision outcomes to be executed by at least one test case. Given a program, our CDC-based technique first uses a revised version of a symbolic executor, S2E, to collect all program decisions with symbolic variables as well as their corresponding constraints and then applies a combinatorial test generation tool, ACTS, to generate t-way combinations for the outcomes of these decisions. A test case can be generated with respect to each combination that represents a single path-condition of the program. Case studies were conducted on three versions of photo editing applications. Our results indicate that a test set generated using the proposed technique has higher statement, decision, and all use coverage as well as better fault detection strength than a test set of the same size generated by random testing and genetic algorithm-based test generation.');

Modelling the navigation structure of a dynamic web application is particularly challenging because of the presence of a large number of pages that are created dynamically and the difficulty of reaching a dynamic page unless a set of appropriate input values are provided for the parameters. To address the first challenge, some form of abstraction is required to enable scalable modelling. For the second challenge, techniques are required to select appropriate input values for parameters and systematically combine them to reach new pages. This paper presents a combinatorial approach in building a navigation graph for dynamic web applications. The navigation graph can then be used to automatically generate test sequences for testing web applications. The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we use an abstraction scheme to control the page explosion problem, where pages that are likely to have the same navigation behaviour are grouped together and are represented as a single node in the navigation graph. Second, assuming that values of individual parameters are supplied manually or generated from other techniques, we combine parameter values such that well-defined combinatorial coverage of input parameter values is achieved. Using combinatorial coverage can significantly reduce the number of requests that have to be submitted while still achieving effective coverage of the navigation structure. We implement our combinatorial approach in a tool, Tansuo, and apply the tool on seven open-source web applications. We evaluate the effectiveness of Tansuo\'s exploration process guided by t-way coverage, for t = 1,2,3, with respect to code coverage, and find that the navigation structure exploration by Tansuo, in general, results in high code coverage (more than 80% statement coverage for most of our subject applications when dead code is removed). We compare Tansuo\'s effectiveness with two other navigation graph tools and find that Tansuo is more effective. Our empirical results indicate that using pairwise coverage in Tansuo results in the efficient generation of navigation graphs and effective exploration of dynamic web applications.

In its simple form, a combinatorial strategy can reduce several input parameters (configurations) of a system into a small set based on their interaction (or combination). In practice, the input configurations of software systems are subjected to constraints, especially in case of highly configurable systems. To implement this feature within a strategy, many difficulties arise for construction. While there are many combinatorial interaction testing strategies nowadays, few of them support constraints. Objective: This paper presents a new strategy, to construct combinatorial interaction test suites in the presence of constraints. Method: The design and algorithms are provided in detail. To overcome the multi-judgment criteria for an optimal solution, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization and multithreading are used. The strategy and its associated algorithms are evaluated extensively using different benchmarks and comparisons. Results: Our results are promising as the evaluation results showed the efficiency and performance of each algorithm in the strategy. The benchmarking results also showed that the strategy can generate constrained test suites efficiently as compared to state-of-the-art strategies. Conclusion: The proposed strategy can form a new way for constructing of constrained combinatorial interaction test suites. The strategy can form a new and effective base for future implementations.');

The ordered reduced test suite can be executed in time constrained situations, where, even if test execution is stopped early, the best test cases from the reduced suite will already be executed.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nIn this paper, we present several approaches to order reduced test suites using experimentally verified prioritization criteria for the domain of web applications.

After coloring, a group of vertices in same color can be transformed to exactly a valid test.

PCFHH uses a combination of three measures to select and apply an effective low-level heuristic from a set of four low-level heuristics at any stage of the search. Our experimental results have been encouraging as PCFHH outperforms most of pairwise test generation strategies on many of the problem instances.');

However, this approach is not feasible in many cases due to the large number of experiments needed in order to effectively select the optimized feature set. In this paper, we propose the use of an experiment based feature selection guided by combinatorial methods such as t-way coverage. This approach can significantly reduce the required number of experiments in a study while selecting the best feature set to achieve a high level of accuracy. We conducted a case study of the feature selection process for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of biomedical images for cell typing. Three thousand labeled images were used in the experimental SVM classification, and 32 features were evaluated for each image. We considered feature sets of different sizes ranging from 6 to 32, and, for each size, we generated t- way combinations of features for t from 2 to 6. The accuracy of each combinatorial combination was evaluated, which allowed us to select the optimal set of features for use in the classification process. The experiment results show that the proposed approach is an effective way to conduct feature selection and that it can be adapted easily for feature selection in other machine learning algorithms.');

Pairwise testing is a combinatorial technique used to generate test suites by varying the values of each pair of input parameters to a system until all possible combinations of those parameters are created. There is some evidence suggesting that these kinds of techniques are efficient and relatively good at detecting software faults. Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence on the comparison of these combinatorial testing techniques with, what is perceived as, rigorous manually handcrafted testing. In this study we compare pairwise test suites with test suites created manually by engineers for 45 industrial programs. The test suites were evaluated in terms of fault detection, code coverage and number of tests. The results of this study show that pairwise testing, while useful for achieving high code coverage and fault detection for the majority of the programs, is almost as effective in terms of fault detection as manual testing. The results also suggest that pairwise testing is just as good as manual testing at fault detection for 64% of the programs.');

An important premise to provide better support for feature interactions in variable systems is the need of a deeper understanding on how features interact at different levels starting from the source level. In this context, recent work has looked at feature interactions from different angles and for different purposes, for instance for developing performance models, extracting interfaces for maintenance or describing feature evolution patterns. However, there is a gap in understanding how features interact in fact at the source level in contrast with how features ought to interact according to variability models that describe the valid combinations of features in variable software systems. In this paper we perform an empirical study to explore this gap. We use seven case studies, implemented in Java and C, totalling over nine million LoC, and analysed over seven thousand feature interactions. Our study revealed important inconsistencies between how feature interactions occur at source level and how they are modeled, and corroborated that the majority of source level interactions involve less than three features.

The results show that our approach potentially increases effectiveness in terms of fault detection ratio concerning faults within real-world product-line implementations as well as synthetically seeded faults.

Currently, combinatorial testing usually implies a covering array as the underlying mathematical construct.

These strategies detect failures which are caused by interactions of parameters in the Software under Test(SUT) and by using some sampling mechanisms a covering array test suite is generated.

It is performed to improve the performance, quality and reliability of the software. Various types of testing such as functional testing and structural testing are performed on software to uncover the faults caused by an incorrect code, interaction of input parameters, etc. One of the major factors in deciding the quality of testing is the design of relevant test cases which is crucial for the success of testing. In this paper we concentrate on generating test cases to uncover faults caused by the interaction of input parameters. It is advisable to perform thorough testing but the number of test cases grows exponentially with the increase in the number of input parameters, which makes exhaustive testing of interaction of input parameters imprudent. An alternative to exhaustive testing is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) which requires that every t-way interaction of input parameters be covered by at least one test case. Here, we present a novel strategy ABC-CAG (Artificial Bee Colony-Covering Array Generator) based on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to generate covering an array and a mixed covering array for pair-wise testing. The proposed ABC-CAG strategy is implemented in a tool and experiments are conducted on various benchmark problems to evaluate the ecacy of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that ABC-CAG generates better/comparable results as compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms');

Evidence shows that faults still escape to customers incurring large warranty costs. Existing test methods can be ineffective in testing robustness with the primary focus being on requirements validation. Evidence from other industries such as IT and medical suggests faults that are difficult to find, manifest due to complex interactions and sequences of events. Whilst model based approaches are becoming more prevalent, they are still an abstraction of the real world and deal with \'time\' at this conceptual level. This can leave some doubt on their validity for representing real-time testing. However, there is little evidence within the literature pointing to effective sequence interaction testing (SIT) within real-time test environments. The novelty of the proposed approach is a methodology for creating and running t-way input sequence interaction test suites in real-time with the time between input events (TBE) considered as a critical test parameter. The effect of TBE on the triggering of faults for a safety monitoring system deployed in a prototype embedded electric machine control unit is presented to demonstrate the approach.

In some system, faults may also be caused by more than two parameters. As the number of parameter interaction coverage (i.e. the strength) increases, the number of t-way test set also increases exponentially.

In addition, the number of test cases at 100% coverage for high-way is huge, which is beyond the farthest test overhead restrictions. Covering array is typically used as the test suite in CT, which should convey much information for the fault detection. We firstly proposed a weighted combinatorial coverage (CC), focusing on the fault detection capability of each test case instead of 100% percent t-way CC. Secondly, we give the test case selection algorithm FWA (fixed weight algorithm) using weighted CC metric. For generating each test case, our method first randomly generates several candidates, and selects the one that has the highest fault-detection possibility with the different sampling pool size.

In this paper, a strategy for GUI functional testing using Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) is proposed. The SSO is used to generate an optimized test suite with the help of Event-Interaction Graph (EIG). The proposed strategy also manages and repairs the test suites by deleting the unnecessary event sequences that are not applicable. The proposed generation algorithm based on SSO has proved its effectiveness by evaluating it against other algorithms. In addition, the strategy is applied on a standard case study and proved its applicability in reality.');

As a consequence, a program can behave differently at each execution because it is automatically adapted to the resources available at each moment. Therefore, when the program has a design fault, this could be revealed in some executions and masked in others. However, during testing, these faults are usually masked because the test infrastructure is stable, and they are only revealed in production because the environment is more aggressive with infrastructure failures, among other reasons. This paper proposes new testing techniques that aimed to detect these design faults by simulating different infrastructure configurations. The testing techniques generate a representative set of infrastructure configurations that as whole are more likely to reveal failures using random testing, and partition testing together with combinatorial testing. The techniques are automated by using a test execution engine called MRTest that is able to detect these faults using only the test input data, regardless of the expected output.

Even for moderately sized software systems, comprehensive testing sometimes becomes impossible due to limited time availability for validation phase. Empirical studies have indicated that most of the faults in software systems often precipitate by interaction between smaller numbers of instruction specifications. If designers can cover all available interactions between all pairs of instructions specifications (instead of comprehensive testing), it can give reasonable confidence to designers about the software attribute within the limited time. This paper presents one such approach which uses the sequence origination approach for pairwise test case origination. This approach makes certain to propagate the required intent of trial run cases which cover all available interactions between all instructions pairs at least once.

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid Q-learning sine-cosine- based strategy, called the Q-learning sine-cosine algorithm (QLSCA). Within the QLSCA, we eliminate the switching probability. Instead, we rely on the Q-learning algorithm (based on the penalty and reward mechanism) to dynamically identify the best operation during runtime. Additionally, we integrate two new operations (Lévy flight motion and crossover) into the QLSCA to facilitate jumping out of local minima/maxima and enhance the solution diversity. To assess its performance, we adopt the QLSCA for the combinatorial test suite minimization problem. Experimental results reveal that the QLSCA is statistically superior with regard to test suite size reduction compared to recent state-of-the-art strategies, including the original SCA, the particle swarm test generator (PSTG), adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and the cuckoo search strategy (CS) at the 95% confidence level.

The Interaction coverage-based TCP (ICTCP) uses interaction coverage information derived from the model input to order inputs. Previous studies have focused generally on the fixed-strength ICTCP, which adopts a fixed strength (i.e., the level of parameter interactions) to support the ICTCP process. It is generally accepted that using more strengths for ICTCP, i.e., mixed-strength ICTCP, may give better ordering than fixed-strength. To confirm whether mixed-strength is better than fixed-strength, in this paper, we report on an extensive empirical study using five real-world programs (written in C), each of which has six versions. The results of the empirical studies show that mixed-strength has better rates of interaction coverage overall than fixed-strength, but they have very similar rates of fault detection.

These test vectors are measured and analyzed using a combinatorial approach, which was made feasible via developing the necessary input models. The extracted model from the test data in combination with combinatorial coverage measurements allows to extract information about the structure of the test vectors. Our analysis shows that some test sets do not achieve full combinatorial coverage. It is further discussed, how this retrieved knowledge could be used as a means of test quality analysis, by incorporating residual risk estimation techniques based on combinatorial methods, in order to assist the overall validation testing procedure.');

However, the robustness of DL systems recently becomes great concerns, where minor perturbation on the input might cause the DL malfunction. These robustness issues could potentially result in severe consequences when a DL system is deployed to safety-critical applications and hinder the real-world deployment of DL systems. Testing techniques enable the robustness evaluation and vulnerable issue detection of a DL system at an early stage. The main challenge of testing a DL system attributes to the high dimensionality of its inputs and large internal latent feature space, which makes testing each state almost impossible. For traditional software, combinatorial testing (CT) is an effective testing technique to balance the testing exploration effort and defect detection capabilities. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study of CT on DL systems. We propose a set of combinatorial testing criteria specialized for DL systems, as well as a CT coverage guided test generation technique. Our evaluation demonstrates that CT provides a promising avenue for testing DL systems.');

Thus, these methods have a limitation in that they do not consider design decisions for variability represented in design-time artifacts. This paper aims to propose a CTD method that uses design-time variability, called the DesignTimeCTD method, considering variability-related decisions at design stage and investigating the effectiveness of reducing the number of tests. The DesignTimeCTD uses variability model, variation points in design-time artifacts, and variability implementation mechanisms used for implementation together in order to reduce the number of tests. As a result, the CTD method, which uses design-time decisions for variability, contributes to reducing the test case by approximately 14% by allowing test engineers to consider design-time variability-related decisions together.');

We further carry out a comparison of a CA generation strategy that has an analogue in the SC world with one developed specifically for CAs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we experiment with several problem instances for CA and WBCA generation, and compare CA solvers versus SC solvers, both in quality of their output size and covered weights, as well as computation time.

It is also important to prioritize representative products, because it could improve the effectiveness of core asset testing especially when the testing resource is limited. In this paper, we propose a prioritization method for SPL pairwise testing based on user profiles. A user profile is a set of user groups and their occurrence probabilities such as the percentages of user groups in a market that use specific devices, applications or services. These profiles are used as the probabilities of feature choices at decision points such as optional features and alternative features in a FM. Based on that, we calculate the probability for obtaining a feature pairs (PFP for short), and generate representative products with priority. Most researches relate to the probabilities about FM handle the probability for obtaining a single feature (PSF for short). Based on PSF, we could estimate PFP. However, this estimation is not appropriate for the prioritization especially when conditional probabilities appear in user profiles. In our method, we directly calculate PFP and determine the priorities. We evaluate the method to show advantages of prioritizations using PFP over those using PSF, and also analyze the characteristics of the method.');

In the context of cloud computing, SaaS is a new software delivery model, in which mission-critical applications are composed, deployed, and executed on cloud platforms. Testing SaaS applications is challenging because new applications need to be tested once they are composed, and prior to their deployment. A composition of components providing services yields a configuration providing an SaaS application. While individual components in the configuration may have been thoroughly tested, faults still arise due to interactions among the components composed, making the configuration faulty. When there are k components, combinatorial testing algorithms can be used to identify faulty interactions with t or fewer components, for some threshold 2 ≤ t ≤ k on the size of interactions considered. In general, these methods do not identify specific faults, but rather indicate the presence or absence of some faults. To identify specific faults, an adaptive testing regime repeatedly constructs and tests configurations in order to determine, for each interaction of interest, whether it is faulty or not. In order to perform such testing in a loosely coupled distributed environment such as the cloud, it is imperative that testing results can be combined from many different servers. The TA defines rules to permit results to be combined, and to identify the faulty interactions. Using the TA, configurations can be tested concurrently on different servers and in any order. The TA always keeps the high reduction rate of potential faulty configurations in fault location analysis.');

Finite State Machines (FSMs) can easily represent event-based systems where certain inputs are valid only in some states and such constraints can be represented by the incompleteness of the FSM. In this paper, we propose an approach to CST where tests are generated from FSMs which are represented by automata together with test requirements. First, automata can be used to check if test sequences contain invalid inputs. We propose three methods to repair tests with invalid inputs. Moreover, we can directly embed into automata the system constraints over the inputs during generations, to generate only valid test sequences. We compare our automata-based method with the standard approach of Sequences Covering Arrays (SCAs) that produces a set of sequences, all with the same length, composed by the permutation of all the events supported by the system.

A valid test in the test space is defined to be an assignment of one value to each parameter that satisfies the constraints. A CTD algorithm automatically constructs a subset of the set of valid tests, termed a test plan, which covers all valid value combinations of every t parameters, where t is usually a user input. Such a test plan is said to achieve 100% t-way interaction coverage. A significant combinatorial reduction is achieved in the size of the resulting test plan (compared to manually designed test plans for example) because the tests generated by the CTD algorithm are very different from one another, maximizing their added value -- each of them covers as many unique t-way value tuples as possible. Note that tests produced by the algorithm are parameter-value assignments. Generating executable tests from them is often a separate, manual effort.');

The limited application of combinatorial test generation on industrial programs can impact the use of such techniques as Q-EMCQ. Thus, there is a need to evaluate this kind of approach against relevant industrial software, with a purpose to show the degree of interaction required to cover the code as well as finding faults. We applied Q-EMCQ on 37 real-world industrial programs written in Function Block Diagram (FBD) language, which is used for developing a train control management system at Bombardier Transportation Sweden AB. The results show that Q-EMCQ is an efficient technique for test case generation. Addition- ally, unlike the t-wise test suite generation, which deals with the minimization problem, we have also subjected Q-EMCQ to a maximization problem involving the general module clustering to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show the Q-EMCQ is also capable of outperforming the original EMCQ as well as several recent meta/hyper-heuristic including modified choice function, Tabu high-level hyper-heuristic, teaching learning-based optimization, sine cosine algorithm, and symbiotic optimization search in clustering quality within comparable execution time.');

The definition of CDAs requires that all rows of a CDA must satisfy the constraints and the same fault localization capability as the DA must hold except for such inherently undetectable faults. We then propose a computational method for constructing CDAs.

Towards the direction of ensuring the correctness of quantum programs, we propose an approach called QuCAT (QUantum CombinAtorial Testing) for systematic and automated testing of quantum programs by benefiting from combinatorial testing, which has been proven to be cost-effective in testing classical programs. QuCAT supports two combinatorial test suite generation scenarios, i.e., generating combinatorial test suites of a given strength, and incrementally generating and executing combinatorial test suites of increasing strength until a fault is found. The approach employs two types of test oracles to assess test results. We performed an empirical study with 18 faulty versions of quantum programs to evaluate QuCAT with strengths of two, three, and four in the two test generation scenarios. We compare the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial testing of various strengths and random testing (taken as baseline approach). Results show that combinatorial testing always performs better than random testing with the same cost and finds faults more quickly (in terms of required number of test cases).

It can be shockingly effective at finding bugs, but it often requires generating a very large number of inputs to do so. In this paper, we apply ideas from combinatorial testing, a powerful and widely studied testing methodology, to modify the distributions of our random generators so as to find bugs with fewer tests. The key concept is combinatorial coverage, which measures the degree to which a given set of tests exercises every possible choice of values for every small combination of input features.\r\n\r\nIn its “classical” form, combinatorial coverage only applies to programs whose inputs have a very particular shape—essentially, a Cartesian product of finite sets. We generalize combinatorial coverage to the richer world of algebraic data types by formalizing a class of sparse test descriptions based on regular tree expressions. This new definition of coverage inspires a novel combinatorial thinning algorithm for improving the coverage of random test generators, requiring many fewer tests to catch bugs. We evaluate this algorithm on two case studies, a typed evaluator for System F terms and a Haskell compiler, showing significant improvements in both.');

Previous research has shown that testing such systems requires a lot of effort, thus automated testing techniques have found a certain degree of success. However, automated testing has not replaced the need for manual testing, rather a common industrial practice exhibits a balance between automated and manual testing. In this respect, comparing manual testing with automated testing techniques continues to be an interesting topic to investigate. The need for this investigation is most apparent at system-level testing of industrial systems, where there is a lack of results on how different testing techniques perform concerning both structural and system-level metrics such as Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) and requirement coverage. In addition to the coverage, the cost of these techniques will also determine their efficiency and thus practical viability. In this paper, we have developed cost models for efficiency measurement and performed an experimental evaluation of manual testing, model-based testing (MBT), and combinatorial testing (CT) in terms of MC/DC and requirement coverage. The evaluation is done in an industrial context of a safety-critical system that controls several functions on-board the passenger trains. We have reported the dominant conditions of MC/DC affected by each technique while generating MC/DC adequate test suites. Moreover, we investigated differences and overlaps of test cases generated by each of the three techniques. The results showed that all test suites achieved 100% requirement coverage except the test suite generated by the pairwise testing strategy. However, MBT-generated test suites were more MC/DC adequate and provided a higher number of both similar and unique test cases. Moreover, unique test cases generated by MBT had an observable effect on MC/DC, which will complement manual testing to increase MC/DC coverage. The least dominant MC/DC condition fulfilled by the generated test cases by all three techniques is the ‘independent effect of a condition on the outcomes of a decision’. Lastly, the evaluation also showed CT as the most efficient testing technique amongst the three in terms of time required for test generation and execution, but with an added cost parameter of manual identification of expected outcomes.

Although many studies in CT have designed elaborate test suites (called covering arrays) to systemically check each possible factor interaction, they provide weak support to locate the concrete failure-inducing interactions, i.e., the Minimal Failure-causing Schemas (MFS). To this end, a variety of MFS identification approaches have been proposed. However, as this study reveals, these approaches suffer from various issues such as cannot identify multiple overlapping MFSs, cannot handle MFSs with high degrees, cannot be applied to systems with large number of parameters, etc. These issues are essentially caused by the exponential computing complexity of checking every interaction in the test cases. Therefore, they can only focus on a subset of all the possible interactions, resulting in many interactions unnoticed. Ignoring these unnoticed interactions could potentially cause failures that have never been systematically checked. Hence, it is beneficial for MFS identification approaches to identify these interactions. In order to account for these unnoticed interactions in CT, this study introduces the notion of pending schema, based on which a theoretical framework of CT schemas is established. In particular, we formally define the determinability of a schema in CT with respect to given information; as such, the yet-to-be determined schemas are exactly the pending schemas. The relationships between the different schemas (faulty, healthy, and pending) and test cases are also theoretically analyzed. Based on which, we further propose three formulas, along with three corresponding algorithms, for the identification of the pending schemas in failing test cases, and formally prove their correctness. As a result, we reduce the complexity of obtaining pending schemas with respect to the number of factors that may have influences on the software.');

F-CIT expresses the entities to be covered and the space of valid test cases, from which the samples are drawn to obtain full coverage, as constraints. Computing an F-CIT object (i.e., a set of test cases obtaining full coverage under a given coverage criterion) then turns into an interesting constraint solving problem, which we call cov-CSP . cov-CSP aims to divide the constraints, each representing an entity to be covered, into a minimum number of satisfiable clusters, such that a solution for a cluster represents a test case and the collection of all the test cases generated (one per cluster) constitutes an F-CIT object, covering each required entity at least once. To solve the cov-CSP problem, thus to compute F-CIT objects, we first present two constructors. One of these constructors attempts to cover as many entities as possible in a cluster before generating a test case, whereas the other constructor generates a test case first and then marks all the entities accommodated by this test case as covered. We then use these constructors to evaluate F-CIT in three studies, each of which addresses a different CIT problem. In the first study, we develop structure-based F-CIT objects to obtain decision coverage-adequate test suites. In the second study, we develop order-based F-CIT objects, which enhance a number of existing order-based coverage criteria by taking the reachability constraints imposed by graph-based models directly into account when computing interaction test suites. In the third study, we develop usage-based F-CIT objects to address the scenarios, in which standard covering arrays are not desirable due to their sizes, by choosing the entities to be covered based on their usage statistics collected from the field. We also carry out user studies to further evaluate F-CIT. The results of these studies suggest that F-CIT is more flexible than the existing CIT approaches.');

This context-sensitive adaptation technique is supported by a prototype tool named SQLInjector+ and is validated and benchmarked on a representative set of web applications under test.

In particular, to abstract real file systems, the authors developed Promela models optimized to avoid state explosion during model checking and used an SPIN model checker to check these models for detecting corner-case errors during an unexpected power outage. The authors analysed counterexamples generated by model checking to determine an improved file system model that is capable of preventing errors in most mainstream file system types and then rechecked the improved file system model and verified the absence of all critical errors.

One challenge in this area is the combinatorial explosion problem, which is always intended to find the most optimal final test suite that will cover all combinations of a given interaction strength. As such, test case generation has been selected as the most active research area in combinatorial t-way testing as Non-deterministic Polynomial-Time Hardness (NP-hard).

Moreover, APPTS adopts Java Parallel Stream to compute the fitness values of candidate solutions to speed up the generation process.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThe performance of APPTS is evaluated against three alternative tabu search-based algorithms (with different penalty and parallelization mechanisms), and seven state-of-the-art algorithms for CCAG. The results demonstrate the superiority of APPTS over these existing algorithms. In particular, APPTS finds 22 new upper bounds on the sizes of 2-way and 3-way constrained covering arrays.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe adaptive penalty mechanism provides an effective choice for handling constraints in CCAG, and the parallelization can help APPTS reduce the generation cost.');

In this sense, Covering Arrays (CAs) have been used as test-suites to exercise combinations of parameters’ values. However, in some software components, the functionality depends not only on the combination of parameters’ values but also on how the parameters’ values are fed to a software component. Therefore, the need to use sequence coverage arrays (SCAs) to test the order in which the input parameters are defined in a software component naturally arises. The combined use of CAs and SCAs allows the creation of test-suites that exercise the functionality of software components, taking into account the combination of parameters’ values and the order in which these combinations are used. In this paper, three applications of SCAs will be presented. The first application is related to testing the functionality of a water filtering process and only one SCA is required. The second application combines an SCA with a CA to test a user interface of a software component. The third application refers to the construction of wetlands for water bioremediation using a mixed covering array (MCA) and a sequence covering array. The coverage of an SCA is determined by its strength (i.e., the size of the subsequences of variables covered at least once). We present a 3-stage approach to construct SCAs for strengths t∈{3,4,5,6,7,8}. The stages of our approach are a greedy stage that builds an initial SCA one row at-a-time; a post-optimization stage that involves an algorithm for the detection of redundant elements and an algorithm that aims to reduce the cardinality of an SCA, and a metaheuristic stage that is implemented using a simulated annealing algorithm. Relevant computational results are 502 new upper bounds (178 cases for t=3, 177 cases for t=4, 88 cases for t=5, 43 cases for t=6, 12 cases for t=7, and 4 cases for t=8). Also we have compared the performance of our approach with 12 algorithms using a known benchmark consisting of 101 cases, our approach wins in 69 cases (18 cases for t=3, 24 cases for t=4, 24 cases for t=5, and 3 cases for t=6)');

In particular, the set of available benchmarks to asses their correctness, effectiveness and efficiency is rather limited. In this paper, we introduce a new generator of CT benchmarks that essentially borrows the structure contained in the plethora of available Combinatorial Problems from other research communities in order to create meaningful benchmarks.

When constructing a test case, numerous literatures classified t-way strategies into two basic approaches as either One-test-at-a-time approach (OTAT) and One-parameter-at-a-time approach (OPAT). At least three major challenge groups can be encountered when creating test cases. The first one is provision of parameters seeding support that will improve the software quality. The second involves automatically obtaining data regarding parameter constraints and identifying interactions between system components. The last one is the execution speed and the test suite size. However, in all the existing OPAT t-way strategies, given that the system is loaded with this information, testing present-day software systems is made difficult or impossible. This study presents an effective combinatorial t-way test case generation strategy named Seeding and Constraint support in In-Parameter-Order Generalized (SCIPOG), to develop an improved paired testing approach. However, the study examines the present state-of-the-art and compares several OPAT strategies found in the literature. Moreover, experiments are discussed as part of this process to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation. When statistically analyzing the findings, two non-parametric tests—the Wilcoxon Rank and Friedman tests–were run. SCIPOG, however, produced competitive results. Finally, SCIPOG showed the efficiency of the two proposed methods, which are seeding and constraint support in IPOG strategy.\r\n\r\n');

Furthermore, for the algorithm based on Boltzmann machines, we consider newly designed versions, where we deploy structural changes of the underlying Boltzmann machine, adding a feedback loop. Additionally, one variant of this algorithm employs learning techniques based on neural networks to adjust the various connections encountered in the graph representing the considered set cover instances.

It is recognized that pairwise testing (i.e., CIT with t=2) is the most common CIT technique, and has high fault detection capability in practice. The problem of pairwise CA generation (PCAG), which is a core problem in pairwise testing, aims at generating a pairwise CA (i.e., 2-wise CA) of minimum size, subject to hard constraints. The PCAG problem is a hard combinatorial optimization problem, which urgently requires practical methods for generating pairwise CAs (PCAs) of small sizes. However, existing PCAG algorithms suffer from the severe scalability issue; that is, when solving large-scale PCAG instances, existing state-of-the-art PCAG algorithms usually cost a fairly long time to generate large PCAs, which would make the testing of highly configurable systems both ineffective and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective sampling-based approach dubbed SamplingCA for solving the PCAG problem. SamplingCA first utilizes sampling techniques to obtain a small test suite that covers valid pairwise tuples as many as possible, and then adds a few more test cases into the test suite to ensure that all valid pairwise tuples are covered. Extensive experiments on 125 public PCAG instances show that our approach can generate much smaller PCAs than its state-of-the-art competitors, indicating the effectiveness of SamplingCA. Also, our experiments show that SamplingCA runs one to two orders of magnitude faster than its competitors, demonstrating the efficiency of SamplingCA. Our results confirm that SamplingCA is able to address the scalability issue and considerably pushes forward the state of the art in PCAG solving.');
